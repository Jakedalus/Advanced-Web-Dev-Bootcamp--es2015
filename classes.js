// 1 - Create a class for a Person. Each person should have a firstName, lastName, favoriteColor, favoriteNumber.

class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, favoriteColor, favoriteNumber) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.favoriteColor = favoriteColor;
    this.favoriteNumber = favoriteNumber;
  }
  
  multiplyFavoriteNumber(num) {
    return num * this.favoriteNumber;
  }
}

/* 2 - Add an instance method called multiplyFavoriteNumber that accepts one parameter and returns the product of the parameter multiplied with the favoriteNumber property on a person object.
    
Examples:    
    var person = new Person("Elie", "Schoppik", "purple", 34)
    person.multiplyFavoriteNumber(10) // 340

*/

var person = new Person("Elie", "Schoppik", "purple", 34)
console.log(person);
console.log(person.multiplyFavoriteNumber(10)); // 340


// 1 - Create a class for for a Vehicle. Each vehicle should have a make, model and year property.

class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

    return 'VROOM!';
  }
  
  toString() {
    return `The make, model, and year are ${this.make} ${this.model} ${this.year}`;
  }
}

// 2 - Add an instance method called start which returns the string "VROOM!"

// 3 - Add an instance method called toString which returns the string "The make, model, and year are" concatenated with the make, model and year property

/* Examples 
    var vehicle = new Vehicle("Tractor", "John Deere", 1999)
    vehicle.toString() // 'The make, model, and year are Tractor John Deere 1999'
*/

var vehicle = new Vehicle("Tractor", "John Deere", 1999);
console.log(vehicle.toString()); // 'The make, model, and year are Tractor John Deere 1999'

// 4 - Create a class for a Car. Each object created from the Car function should also have a make, model, and year and a property called numWheels which should be 4. The Car prototype should inherit all of the methods from the Vehicle prototype

class Car extends Vehicle{
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    super(make, model, year);
    this.numWheels = 4;
  }
}

// 5 - Create a class for a Motorcycle. Each object created from the Motorcycle function should also have a make, model, and year and a property called numWheels which should be 2. The Motorcycle prototype should inherit all of the methods from the Vehicle prototype

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle{
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    super(make, model, year);
    this.numWheels = 2;
  }
}
